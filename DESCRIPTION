Description: Provides an interface for Thermo Fisher Scientifc raw files
        branched from rawDiag. This package wraps the functionality
	of the RawFileReader .NET assembly. Within the R environment
	spectra and chromatograms are represented by S3 objects.
	All objects are currently kept in memory.
