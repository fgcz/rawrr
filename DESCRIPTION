Description: This package wraps the functionality
    of the RawFileReader .NET assembly. Within the R environment,
    spectra and chromatograms are represented by S3 objects
    (Kockmann T. et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.10.30.362533>).
    The package provides basic functions to download and install
    the required third-party libraries.
    The package is developed, tested, and used at the Functional
    Genomics Center Zurich, Switzerland <https://fgcz.ch>.
